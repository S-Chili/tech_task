## Introduction

This is a project that contains user cards with personal information (name, avatar, number of tweets, number of followers). 

## Properties

You can also see what tweets a user has - by clicking on tweets, and you can follow any user. It is possible to filter users to whom you are subscribed or, conversely, to whom you have not yet subscribed.
